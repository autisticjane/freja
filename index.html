			<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Jane, and I do <mark>smoothies</mark>. ðŸ‘‹</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve loved smoothies since I was a kid, but as I grew up, the adults around me made smoothies less fun: they became less about nutrition, more about eating as little as you can. This was <em>celebrated</em>. It&#8217;s still celebrated today, but the damage has already been done: I developed, and am recovering from, an eating disorder that made me starve myself.</p>
<p>Now, my mission is to duck diets and take back smoothies from the dieting community â€” because I have young sisters and brothers, and cousins. Because I never want even my worst enemy to go through what I&#8217;ve gone through. Because diets suck. Because food rules and imprisonment only lead to a slow, painful death.</p>
<p>Why smoothies, you might be asking? Because I <em>love</em> smoothies. In recovery, I love the fact that a) they&#8217;re like bonus calories, since water has none; and b) the colors of my smoothies are fun to look at. That psychology about <a href="https://www.chefify.net/academy/article/psychology-behind-food-plating">eating pretty food</a>? I believe it.</p>
<p>There is just something about playing with color â€” and that color being food-based â€” that excites. If you were ever told not to play with your food, you understand the joys of defying authority. We defy authority <em>all the time</em> at <em>Smoothies by Color</em>, so you&#8217;ll fit in well here.~</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s the gist of this blog!</p>

<h2>Now for some juicy deets about me:</h2>
<ol>
<li>I&#8217;m learning Japanese off and on â€” primarily because manga takes so long to get licensed in English, and I have needs. The general consensus is that a) learning a new language as an adult is harder and b) learning Japanese would be pointless, but I&#8217;m picking it up quicker than I did Spanish. At this point, I <em>would</em> like to be skilled enough to take the proficiency test, but it&#8217;s not something I&#8217;m holding out for.</li>
<li>My favorite drama is in the form of fiction, which makes sense â€” humans have relied on stories since the beginning of time, and there are more benefits to reading fiction than there are nonfiction.</li>
<li>I bit my nails for 27 years until the day that I stopped starving myself. No, I wasn&#8217;t <em>hungry</em>, per se. Apparently, biting my nails was a way to relieve stress â€” and relieving myself of it made nail-biting less appealing. Now, I groom them religiously instead, &#8217;cause my fingernails are an extension of myself, the way they look an illustration of my personality and quirks.</li>
<li>Classical music hits me right in the feels; it moves me. I rock out to it. My top two favorites are Pachelbelâ€™s &#8220;Canon&#8221; and Bizetâ€™s &#8220;Habanera&#8221;. I also enjoy instrumental versions of popular songs; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlrjXZEQ_s0">Brooklyn Duo</a> is my favorite artist in that department. <strong>More music-wise:</strong> I&#8217;m all over the place. I love the classic Britney Spears and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOWkNKOiJMc">Evanescence</a>, plus Fall Out Boy and indie artists like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMA4vDwP7n4">K.Flay</a>. I seldom care for any country music.</li>
<li><em>Little Einsteins</em> puts me to sleep, no matter the time of day or how much Iâ€™ve slept. So do <em>Octonauts</em> and <em>My Little Ponies</em> if I watch either long enough.</li>
<li>This isn&#8217;t my first blog &#8212; that&#8217;s long gone! I do have an active, messy personal blog called <em><a href="https://janepedia.com">Janepedia</a></em> and run <em><a href="https://crunchyfamily.com">Crunchy Family</a></em> with my cousin. I started a separate blog for smoothie recipes because I wanted to sort them by color (hence the title!). After realizing the name was available and over five years had passed since I&#8217;d first entertained the idea of a dedicated smoothie blog, I realized how much I still wanted this.</li>
<li>Look, I donâ€™t claim to have a good personality or to always be set on becoming better. Iâ€™m a fallible human. And I can be quite petty. I do try to keep drama off the table, however, unless itâ€™s fictional, because â€” letâ€™s face it â€” drama is only awesome when itâ€™s fictional.</li>
