Theme for [Smoothies by Color](https://smoothiesbycolor.com). Please don't copy this without credit and instead respect it, 'cause it's my messy love song and could prove embarrassing on your part. *Smoothies by Color* is my smoothie recipe and tips blog, for-profit from the start. I'm not a coding genius, so if you have better ideas for something I did, please let me know!

As [Georgie](https://hey.georgie.nu) has designed themes for my personal blog, I've become familiar with her code, thus adopting her class names and whatnot because it's more a force of habit -- although I do find it's much easier to keep up with than what I've concocted on my own.

## v1.0 "Freja" â€” TBD 2019
> [Release blog post](https://janepedia.com/freja)

Working title: "goldnotter", a misspelling of "goldnotter", as an ode to a classy web designer I admired in high school, who was 2-3 years older than me and created minimalist designs before it was cool.
